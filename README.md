Portfolio Project: Sales Data Analysis and Visualization using Python.
This project is a data analysis of a fictional company's sales data using Python and Google Colab.  
The goal is to uncover insights from over 50,000+ sales records to improve decision-making.

## Objectives
- Understand overall sales performance
- Identify top-performing products, regions, and time periods
- Detect patterns and trends in customer purchasing behavior
## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Colab)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
## Data Description
The dataset contains records of orders over multiple years, including fields such as Customer Name, Product Line, Product Code, Sales Amount, Order Date, Country, Deal Size, etc.

The source data is either sample or public data for demonstration purposes.

Original or sensitive data is excluded for privacy.
## Analysis & Visualizations
The core deliverables include:

- Top Customers by Total Sales: Bar charts and tables identifying highest revenue customers.
- Sales Trend Over Time: Line charts showing monthly and yearly sales dynamics.-
- Product Line Performance: Comparative analysis of sales across product categories.
- Regional Sales: Country-wise sales distribution visualized with bar charts and choropleth maps.
- Deal Size Contribution: Sales by deal size categories visualized for revenue segmentation.
- Top Products per Product Line: Grouped bar charts highlighting leading products within each category.
- Correlation and Outlier Analysis: Heatmaps and boxplots to detect data patterns and anomalies.
- Sales Forecasting (Optional): Linear regression models predicting next yearâ€™s sales.
## How to Run
- Open the Jupyter Notebook analysis.ipynb in your preferred environment.
- Run cells sequentially to reproduce the full analysis and visualizations.
- Adjust dataset path or parameters as necessary.
- Export desired visualizations or summary CSVs from provided cells.
